    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p><strong>Academic Interests:</strong> Born and raised in the Bay Area, California, I’ve been captivated by the natural world for as long as I can remember. My love for geology started early—some of my first treasures were rocks I collected as a toddler. Over time, what began as childhood curiosity grew into a career calling. While studying at Chico State, I delved into the petrology and geochemistry of local Iron-Oxide-Copper-Gold deposits, and I was fortunate to present my research at the 2024 GSA Conference in Spokane, WA. In May, I earned my Bachelor’s Degree in Geology, and I’m currently expanding my skills by pursuing a GIS certificate from Cal Poly Humboldt. I also work as a Geologist at a consulting firm that helps manage groundwater resources in Northern California, where I do a lot of report writing, GIS map making, and rewarding field work. When I’m not immersed in rocks and research, you can find me exploring the outdoors through hiking and camping, capturing the beauty of nature with my camera, or getting creative with painting and digital art. I’m also a big fan of live music and love attending concerts whenever I get the chance.</p>
